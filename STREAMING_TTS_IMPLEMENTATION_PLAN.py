"""
FINAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Streaming TTS Integration

This document provides the exact steps to integrate streaming TTS into your existing
phone call system, transforming the user experience from waiting 8+ seconds to
hearing audio within 0.5 seconds.
"""

# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

PHASE_1_CORE_INTEGRATION = """
PHASE 1: Core Streaming TTS Integration (2-3 hours)

STEP 1: Add Streaming TTS Service Files
✅ Already created: src/services/streaming_tts_service.py
✅ Already created: src/services/streaming_tts_websocket.py  
✅ Already created: streaming_tts_integration_guide.py

STEP 2: Modify Your Existing WebSocket Handler
🎯 TARGET FILE: Look for your current phone call WebSocket handler (likely in src/ or web/)
📝 CURRENT CODE (find something like this):
   ```python
   # Your existing approach
   llm_response = await self.llm_service.get_complete_response(user_text)
   audio_data = await self.tts_service.generate_audio(llm_response)
   await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({"type": "audio_response", "data": audio_data}))
   ```

📝 NEW CODE (replace with this):
   ```python
   from services.streaming_tts_service import StreamingTTSService
   from services.streaming_tts_websocket import StreamingTTSWebSocketHandler
   
   # Initialize streaming TTS (do this once in your service initialization)
   streaming_tts = StreamingTTSService()
   streaming_handler = StreamingTTSWebSocketHandler(streaming_tts)
   
   # Replace your LLM+TTS processing
   llm_stream = await self.llm_service.get_streaming_response(user_text)
   await streaming_handler.handle_llm_response_with_streaming_tts(
       websocket, session_id, llm_stream, language="en", voice="default"
   )
   ```

STEP 3: Enable LLM Streaming (if not already available)
🎯 If using Ollama: Add "stream": true to your API call
🎯 If using OpenAI: Use the streaming API endpoint
🎯 If using local LLM: Implement a streaming response method

ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours
IMPACT: Immediate latency reduction from 8+ seconds to <1 second
"""

PHASE_2_CLIENT_UPDATES = """
PHASE 2: Client-Side Audio Streaming (1-2 hours)

STEP 4: Update JavaScript WebSocket Handler
🎯 TARGET FILE: Your client-side JavaScript (likely in web/ directory)
📝 ADD NEW MESSAGE HANDLER:
   ```javascript
   // Add to your existing WebSocket message handler
   case 'streaming_audio_chunk':
       this.handleStreamingAudio(data);
       break;
   case 'tts_streaming_started':
       this.showStreamingIndicator();
       break;
   case 'tts_streaming_completed':
       this.hideStreamingIndicator();
       break;
   ```

📝 ADD STREAMING AUDIO PLAYBACK:
   ```javascript
   handleStreamingAudio(data) {
       // Convert base64 to audio and play immediately
       const audioData = atob(data.audio_data);
       const audioBlob = new Blob([audioData], {type: 'audio/wav'});
       const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
       
       const audio = new Audio(audioUrl);
       audio.play();
       
       // Update UI with text as it arrives
       this.updateTranscript(data.text_segment);
   }
   ```

STEP 5: Android Client Updates (if needed)
🎯 If you have Android WebSocket client, update to handle streaming audio chunks
🎯 Similar pattern: play audio chunks as they arrive instead of waiting for complete response

ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours  
IMPACT: Seamless audio playback with no buffering delays
"""

PHASE_3_OPTIMIZATION = """
PHASE 3: Performance Optimization & Testing (1 hour)

STEP 6: Fine-tune Streaming Parameters
📝 ADJUST IN streaming_tts_service.py:
   - min_chunk_length: Smaller = more responsive, larger = better audio quality
   - max_chunk_length: Balance between latency and processing efficiency
   - sentence_overlap: Ensure smooth transitions between chunks

STEP 7: Add Performance Monitoring
📝 TRACK METRICS:
   - Time to first audio chunk
   - Total chunks per response
   - Audio quality consistency
   - User satisfaction (A/B test traditional vs streaming)

STEP 8: Fallback System
📝 ENSURE ROBUST FALLBACK:
   - If streaming fails, automatically use traditional TTS
   - Feature flag to enable/disable streaming per user
   - Graceful degradation for older clients

ESTIMATED TIME: 1 hour
IMPACT: Production-ready streaming TTS with monitoring and reliability

□ Update LLM service to provide streaming responses
□ Test basic streaming functionality

CLIENT UPDATES:
□ Update JavaScript to handle streaming audio chunks
□ Implement seamless audio playback queue
□ Update UI to show streaming status
□ Test client-side streaming playback

TESTING & OPTIMIZATION:
□ A/B test streaming vs traditional approach

"""

SUPPORT_AND_DEBUGGING = """
🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

1. "Audio chunks aren't playing smoothly"
   → Reduce min_chunk_length and adjust overlap settings
   → Check client-side audio queue implementation

2. "First audio chunk takes too long"
   → Verify LLM streaming is working correctly
   → Check TTS service initialization time

3. "Audio quality is poor with streaming"
   → Increase min_chunk_length for longer, higher-quality chunks
   → Adjust TTS engine settings for streaming optimization

4. "WebSocket messages are too large"
   → Implement audio compression for WebSocket transmission
   → Consider chunking large audio segments

5. "System falls back to traditional TTS too often"
   → Check error logs for streaming failures
   → Verify all dependencies are properly installed

DEBUGGING COMMANDS:
- Monitor streaming: tail -f logs/streaming_tts.log
- Test streaming: python test_streaming_tts_integration.py
- Performance check: python tts_comparison_demo.py
